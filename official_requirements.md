# To become a maintainer of Nezuko OS:

Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:

1 - You must own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Unified, and devices with minimal hardware changes are also allowed to be maintained.

2 - You must have basic git (cherry-pick, squash, etc)  knowledge.

3 - You must have a daily-drivable unofficial build.

4 - You must have your device sources available publicly with proper authorship for each commit. Exception being for if you use a prebuilt kernel.

5 - Though an Enforcing build isn't necessary, the build must not stay permissive for extended period of time.
